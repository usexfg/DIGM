# DIGM on COLD L3 with Celestia — Explanation

---

## 1. Is DIGM going to be hosted on COLD L3 instead of Fuego?

It's not a replacement, instead a powerful evolution in layering. DIGM becomes an **application** that **leverages the COLD L3 protocol**, which in turn is **secured by the Fuego L1**.

Think of it like a traditional web stack:

| Layer | Analogy | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **DIGM (the application)** | Website / Front-end | Marketplace UI, artist pages, music player |
| **COLD L3** | Application server & database | Smart-contracts, privacy mixer, HEAT payments |
| **Celestia DA** | Hard drive / CDN | Stores big encrypted audio blobs cheaply & verifiably |
| **Fuego L1** | Physical data-center security | PoW chain anchoring COLD, scarcity for XFG/HEAT |

**So, the answer is: yes, ** DIGM will run *on* COLD L3, and COLD L3 is anchored *to* Fuego. We aren't choosing one over the other; we are using them together in concert as a powerful modular stack.

## 2. The Flow of Audio with Celestia (or other Data Availability layer)

### Storage — *Artist Uploads a Track*

1. **Artist uploads** via DIGM UI.
2. **Client-side chunking:** file → 256 KB pieces.
3. **Encrypt each chunk** with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (key owned by artist).
4. **COLD L3 transaction** stores only metadata:
   * Merkle root of encrypted chunks.
   * Price, artist address, etc.
5. **Sequencer posts blobs** to **Celestia**; receives a *data commitment*.
6. **On-chain link finalised:** `TrackNFT → MerkleRoot → CelestiaCommitment`.

### Retrieval — *Listener Plays a Track*

1. **Listener pays** required HEAT fee via COLD mixer.
2. **Smart-contract releases** the decryption key.
3. **Client requests blob** from Celestia using the commitment.
4. **Celestia nodes serve** encrypted chunks (any that hold them).
5. **Client verifies** chunks against Merkle root, decrypts on-the-fly.
6. **Seamless playback** in the browser / mobile app.

## 3. Which Way is More Efficient?

The **COLD L3 + Celestia** architecture is more efficient. 

| Feature | Elder-Node IPFS Model | **COLD L3 + Celestia** |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **Resilience** | Depends on a few dozen pinning nodes | **Professional DA network – 99.99 %** |
| **Scalability** | Limited by node bandwidth | **Horizontal** via Data Availability Sampling |
| **Cost-efficiency** | ~$10 / TB-mo | **<$3 / TB-mo** purpose-built DA |
| **Privacy** | None (IPFS requests are public) | **Full** – mixer + encrypted blobs |
| **Composability** | Low | **High** – EVM smart-contracts, DeFi integration |
| **Narrative / Alpha** | Standard Web3 tech | **Cutting-edge modular blockchain thesis** |

## Conclusion

The **COLD L3 + Celestia** model transforms DIGM from a *"decentralized music app"* into a **private, modular, and highly composable media economy.** We'll explore all the possibilities of other DA layers/storage providers when we get closer to phase 3.
