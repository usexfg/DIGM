# UDST Loan System Design
## Dynamic Interest Rate System for Prompt Repayment Incentives

### Overview
A decentralized lending system where users deposit XFG to create UDST collateral certificates, then use these certificates as collateral for loans. The system rewards prompt repayment with reduced interest rates, creating a sustainable lending ecosystem within the DIGM platform.

---

## üéØ **Core Concept**

### **Dynamic Interest Rate Model**
- **Base Rate**: Standard interest rate for loans
- **Prompt Payment Discount**: Reduced interest for early repayment
- **Collateral-Based**: Loans backed by UDST certificates (dollar-value locked)
- **Community Governed**: Interest rates managed by UDST certificate holders
- **Risk-Adjusted**: Interest rates based on certificate quality and borrower history

## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Architecture**

### **1. Loan Structure**
```rust
struct UDSTLoan {
    loan_id: u64,
    borrower: String,
    collateral_amount: u64,        // XFG amount locked as collateral
    loan_amount: u64,              // UDST amount borrowed
    interest_rate: u64,            // Annual interest rate (basis points)
    term_length: u64,              // Loan term in days
    created_at: u64,              // Loan creation timestamp
    due_date: u64,                // Loan due date
    repaid_at: Option<u64>,        // Repayment timestamp
    status: LoanStatus,            // Active, Repaid, Defaulted, Liquidated
    repayment_history: Vec<Repayment>,
    collateral_ratio: u64,         // Current collateralization ratio
}

enum LoanStatus {
    Active,
    Repaid,
    Defaulted,
    Liquidated,
    GracePeriod,
}

struct Repayment {
    amount: u64,                   // Repayment amount
    timestamp: u64,               // Repayment timestamp
    interest_paid: u64,           // Interest portion of payment
    principal_paid: u64,          // Principal portion of payment
    early_payment_bonus: u64,     // Discount applied for early payment
}
```

### **2. Dynamic Interest Rate Calculation**
```rust
struct InterestRateModel {
    base_rate: u64,               // Base annual interest rate (e.g., 12% = 1200 bps)
    prompt_payment_discount: u64, // Discount for early payment (e.g., 50% = 5000 bps)
    risk_premium: u64,           // Risk-based premium
    collateral_discount: u64,     // Discount for high-quality collateral
    borrower_history_factor: u64, // Factor based on repayment history
}

impl InterestRateModel {
    fn calculate_interest_rate(&self, loan: &DSTLoan, days_early: u64) -> u64 {
        let mut rate = self.base_rate;
        
        // Apply prompt payment discount
        if days_early > 0 {
            let discount = (self.prompt_payment_discount * days_early) / 100;
            rate = rate.saturating_sub(discount);
        }
        
        // Apply risk premium
        rate += self.risk_premium;
        
        // Apply collateral discount
        if loan.collateral_ratio > 200 { // Over-collateralized
            rate = rate.saturating_sub(self.collateral_discount);
        }
        
        // Apply borrower history factor
        rate = (rate * self.borrower_history_factor) / 10000;
        
        // Ensure minimum rate
        rate.max(100) // Minimum 1% annual rate
    }
}
```

## üí∞ **Economic Model**

### **1. Interest Rate Tiers**

#### **Prompt Payment Discounts:**
```typescript
const promptPaymentDiscounts = {
  // Repay within 24 hours of loan creation
  '24h': {
    discount: 0.75,        // 75% interest reduction
    description: 'Ultra-early repayment bonus'
  },
  
  // Repay within 7 days
  '7d': {
    discount: 0.50,        // 50% interest reduction
    description: 'Early repayment bonus'
  },
  
  // Repay within 30 days
  '30d': {
    discount: 0.25,        // 25% interest reduction
    description: 'Prompt repayment bonus'
  },
  
  // Repay on time (by due date)
  'ontime': {
    discount: 0.10,        // 10% interest reduction
    description: 'On-time repayment bonus'
  },
  
  // Late payment penalty
  'late': {
    penalty: 0.50,         // 50% interest increase
    description: 'Late payment penalty'
  }
};
```

#### **Collateral Quality Discounts:**
```typescript
const collateralDiscounts = {
  // Over-collateralized loans (200%+)
  'over_collateralized': {
    ratio: 200,
    discount: 0.20,        // 20% interest reduction
    description: 'Over-collateralization bonus'
  },
  
  // Well-collateralized loans (150-200%)
  'well_collateralized': {
    ratio: 150,
    discount: 0.10,        // 10% interest reduction
    description: 'Well-collateralized bonus'
  },
  
  // Standard collateralized loans (120-150%)
  'standard': {
    ratio: 120,
    discount: 0.00,        // No discount
    description: 'Standard collateralization'
  },
  
  // Under-collateralized loans (<120%)
  'under_collateralized': {
    ratio: 120,
    penalty: 0.30,         // 30% interest increase
    description: 'Under-collateralization penalty'
  }
};
```

### **2. Borrower Reputation System**
```rust
struct BorrowerReputation {
    borrower: String,
    total_loans: u64,
    repaid_loans: u64,
    defaulted_loans: u64,
    average_repayment_time: u64,  // Average days to repayment
    prompt_payment_ratio: u64,    // Percentage of prompt payments
    credit_score: u64,            // 0-1000 credit score
    last_activity: u64,
}

impl BorrowerReputation {
    fn calculate_credit_score(&self) -> u64 {
        let repayment_rate = (self.repaid_loans * 10000) / self.total_loans;
        let prompt_payment_bonus = self.prompt_payment_ratio;
        let time_bonus = if self.average_repayment_time < 7 { 100 } else { 0 };
        
        (repayment_rate + prompt_payment_bonus + time_bonus).min(1000)
    }
    
    fn get_interest_rate_factor(&self) -> u64 {
        match self.credit_score {
            900..=1000 => 8000,  // 20% discount for excellent credit
            800..=899  => 9000,   // 10% discount for good credit
            700..=799  => 9500,   // 5% discount for fair credit
            600..=699  => 10000,  // No discount for average credit
            500..=599  => 10500,  // 5% penalty for below average
            _          => 11000,  // 10% penalty for poor credit
        }
    }
}
```

## üîÑ **Operational Mechanisms**

### **1. Loan Creation Process**
```typescript
async function createLoan(
  borrower: string,
  collateralAmount: number,
  loanAmount: number,
  termLength: number
): Promise<DSTLoan> {
  // 1. Validate borrower
  const borrowerRep = await getBorrowerReputation(borrower);
  
  // 2. Calculate interest rate
  const interestRate = await calculateInterestRate(
    collateralAmount,
    loanAmount,
    termLength,
    borrowerRep
  );
  
  // 3. Lock XFG collateral
  await lockXFGCollateral(borrower, collateralAmount);
  
  // 4. Create loan
  const loan = await createLoanRecord({
    borrower,
    collateralAmount,
    loanAmount,
    interestRate,
    termLength,
    dueDate: Date.now() + (termLength * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  });
  
  // 5. Transfer DST loan amount to borrower
  await transferDST(loanAmount, borrower);
  
  return loan;
}
```

### **2. Repayment Process**
```typescript
async function repayLoan(
  loanId: number,
  repaymentAmount: number,
  borrower: string
): Promise<RepaymentResult> {
  const loan = await getLoan(loanId);
  
  // Calculate interest based on repayment timing
  const daysEarly = calculateDaysEarly(loan.dueDate);
  const interestRate = calculateDynamicInterestRate(loan, daysEarly);
  
  // Calculate interest owed
  const interestOwed = calculateInterestOwed(loan, interestRate);
  
  // Apply prompt payment discount
  const discount = calculatePromptPaymentDiscount(daysEarly);
  const finalInterest = interestOwed * (1 - discount);
  
  // Process repayment
  const repayment = await processRepayment({
    loanId,
    amount: repaymentAmount,
    interestPaid: finalInterest,
    principalPaid: repaymentAmount - finalInterest,
    earlyPaymentBonus: interestOwed - finalInterest,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  
  // Update borrower reputation
  await updateBorrowerReputation(borrower, repayment);
  
  // Unlock XFG collateral
  await unlockXFGCollateral(borrower, loan.collateralAmount);
  
  return repayment;
}
```

### **3. Interest Rate Calculation**
```typescript
function calculateDynamicInterestRate(
  loan: DSTLoan,
  daysEarly: number
): number {
  let rate = loan.baseInterestRate;
  
  // Apply prompt payment discount
  if (daysEarly > 0) {
    const discount = Math.min(daysEarly * 0.01, 0.75); // Max 75% discount
    rate *= (1 - discount);
  }
  
  // Apply collateral quality discount
  if (loan.collateralRatio > 200) {
    rate *= 0.8; // 20% discount for over-collateralization
  } else if (loan.collateralRatio > 150) {
    rate *= 0.9; // 10% discount for well-collateralization
  }
  
  // Apply borrower reputation factor
  const reputationFactor = getBorrowerReputationFactor(loan.borrower);
  rate *= reputationFactor;
  
  // Ensure minimum rate
  return Math.max(rate, 0.01); // Minimum 1% annual rate
}
```
