# DIGM × COLD L3 × Celestia Architecture

> **Version:** July 2025 · **Status:** Architecture overview

---

## 1 · Layered Stack at a Glance

| Layer | Role | Key Tech |
|-------|------|----------|
| **DIGM App** | Marketplace UI, artist pages, music player | React, Wallet Providers |
| **COLD L3** | Smart-contract logic, privacy mixer, HEAT payments | EVM-compatible roll-up, Halo2 ZK, Tendermint, merge-mined with Fuego |
| **Celestia DA** | Cheap, verifiable blob storage for large audio chunks | Namespaced DA, DAS sampling |
| **Fuego L1** | Base-layer PoW chain & XFG asset backing HEAT | CryptoNote PoW, 8-min blocks |

*Mnemonic:* **App ↔︎ Logic ↔︎ Storage ↔︎ Security**

---

## 2 · Why This Matters

1. **Resilience** – Celestia replicates data across hundreds of nodes; COLD anchors to Fuego’s PoW → no single point of failure.
2. **Privacy** – COLD’s mixer + encrypted blobs hide both payments *and* listening habits.
3. **Cost-Efficiency** – Purpose-built DA layer beats general-purpose cloud by 10–20× at scale.
4. **Composability** – Music NFTs, streaming receipts, fan DAOs—all live on an EVM chain.

## 3 · Data Flow

### 3.1 Artist Upload

```text
🎤  Artist → DIGM UI
    │ 1. Split file → 256 KB chunks
    │ 2. Encrypt chunks (ChaCha20)
    ▼
COLD L3 tx: { MerkleRoot, price, metadata }
    │  (no raw audio!)
    ▼
COLD Sequencer → Celestia
    └─► Posts encrypted blob, gets DataCommitment ↩︎
```

On-chain record: `TrackNFT → MerkleRoot → CelestiaCommitment`

### 3.2 Listener Playback

```text
👂  Listener pays HEAT → COLD mixer
    │  Smart-contract releases decryption key
    ▼
Client fetches blob via Celestia light-client
    │  Verifies chunks against MerkleRoot
    ▼
Decrypts on the fly → HTML5 <audio> stream
```

## 4 · Resilience & “Alpha” Scorecard

| Feature | Elder-Node IPFS | **COLD L3 + Celestia** |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Data durability | Good | **99.99 %** (erasure-coded blobs) |
| Scalability | Limited by node bandwidth | **Horizontal** via DAS |
| Cost / TB | ≈ $10 | **< $3** |
| Built-in privacy | ❌ | **✔ Mixer + encrypted blobs** |
| DeFi composability | Low | **High** (EVM contracts) |

> **Verdict:** The modular stack wins across every dimension.

## 5 · Economic Loop

1. **XFG Burn** → mints **HEAT** on COLD.  
2. **HEAT** used to buy/stream tracks.  
3. Storage & bandwidth providers earn HEAT; listeners earn PARA rewards.  
4. Circular fly-wheel: more burns → more HEAT demand → scarcer XFG.

## 6 · Roadmap Snapshot

| Phase | Milestone | ETA |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | DIGM frontend ↔︎ COLD RPC, HEAT payments PoC | Q3-25 |
| 2 | Anonymous uploads, mixer integration | Q4-25 |
| 3 | Full erasure-coded storage across elder nodes | Q1-26 |

## 7 · Key Advantages Over Competitors

* **100 % Artist Revenue** – No platform cut.  
* **Listener Privacy** – No tracking, no ads.  
* **Permanent Availability** – Celestia DA + Fuego PoW anchoring.  
* **Modular Upgradeability** – Swap any layer without disrupting others.
