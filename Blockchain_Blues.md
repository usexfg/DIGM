# Blockchain Blues
*by Decentralized Soul*

## Verse 1
In the digital age, where data flows like streams  
We're building something new, fulfilling all our dreams  
From centralized control to decentralized power  
DIGM platform rising, growing stronger by the hour  

## Chorus
Blockchain blues, we're singing the truth  
Decentralized music, that's what we do  
PARA tokens flowing, rewards for the crew  
DIGM platform, we're breaking through  

## Verse 2
No more middlemen taking cuts from artists' pay  
Direct connections, that's the DIGM way  
Smart contracts executing, transparent and fair  
Every stream, every play, we're all aware  

## Bridge
From Stellar to Fuego, multi-chain design  
Platform metrics stored, everything aligned  
Privacy preserved, yet transparent too  
That's the DIGM vision, making dreams come true  

## Verse 3
Artists upload their tracks, listeners earn rewards  
PARA mining system, breaking down the wards  
Premium access, XFG mining too  
DIGM ecosystem, everything is new  

## Final Chorus
Blockchain blues, we're singing the truth  
Decentralized music, that's what we do  
PARA tokens flowing, rewards for the crew  
DIGM platform, we're breaking through
