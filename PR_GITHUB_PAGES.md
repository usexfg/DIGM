# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Configuration

## 📋 Overview

This PR adds comprehensive GitHub Pages deployment configuration to the DIGM Platform, enabling automatic deployment of the React frontend to GitHub Pages with continuous integration.

## ✨ Features Added

### 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Automatic Deployment**: Triggers on pushes to `main` branch
- **Build Process**: Installs dependencies, builds React app, deploys to GitHub Pages
- **Caching**: Optimized with npm cache for faster builds
- **Environment**: Uses Node.js 18 for compatibility

### 📦 Frontend Configuration
- **Homepage URL**: Configured for `https://aejt.github.io/digm-platform`
- **Deployment Scripts**: Added `predeploy` and `deploy` npm scripts
- **Dependencies**: Added `gh-pages` package for deployment
- **Router**: Updated to use `HashRouter` for GitHub Pages compatibility

### 🎨 Public Assets
- **HTML Template**: Created proper `index.html` with meta tags and font preloading
- **Web App Manifest**: Added `manifest.json` for PWA capabilities

## 🎯 Next Steps

After merging this PR:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Select "GitHub Actions" as source
   - Site will be available at https://aejt.github.io/digm-platform

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Check Actions tab for build status
   - Verify site functionality
   - Test all features on live deployment

3. **Future Updates**:
   - Push to `main` branch for automatic deployment
   - Monitor build logs for any issues
   - Update documentation as needed

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **GitHub Pages**: Static hosting only (no backend API)
- **HashRouter**: URL format uses `#` for routing
- **Build Time**: GitHub Actions may take 2-5 minutes to complete

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify repository settings
3. Review build output
4. Consult `DEPLOYMENT.md` for troubleshooting
