# ðŸ”§ GitHub Pages Setup Guide

## Current Issue: 404 Error
The site shows 404 because GitHub Pages hasn't been enabled yet. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/usexfg/DIGM
2. **Click Settings** (top navigation)
3. **Scroll down to "Pages"** (left sidebar)
4. **Under "Source"**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. **Save the settings**

## Step 2: Trigger Deployment

After enabling GitHub Actions as the source, we need to trigger the deployment:

```bash
# From your local repository
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Monitor Deployment

1. **Go to Actions tab**: https://github.com/usexfg/DIGM/actions
2. **Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow**
3. **Click on it to see build progress**
4. **Wait for completion** (usually 2-5 minutes)

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once the workflow completes:
- **Check the site**: https://usexfg.github.io/DIGM
- **Should show DIGM Platform** instead of 404

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If GitHub Actions doesn't work, you can deploy manually:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

### If still getting 404:
1. Check if `gh-pages` branch was created
2. Verify GitHub Pages settings
3. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
4. Clear browser cache

### If build fails:
1. Check Actions tab for error logs
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Check for any build errors in the logs

## Expected Result

After successful deployment, you should see:
- âœ… DIGM Platform homepage
- âœ… Navigation working
- âœ… All features functional
- âœ… No 404 errors
