# ðŸ”§ Fix GitHub Pages to Show React App

## Current Issue
GitHub Pages is showing the README.md instead of the DIGM React frontend application.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/usexfg/DIGM/settings/pages
2. **Source**: Should be set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")
3. **Branch**: Should be automatically managed by the workflow

### 2. Check if gh-pages Branch Exists
1. Go to: https://github.com/usexfg/DIGM/branches
2. Look for `gh-pages` branch
3. If it doesn't exist, the deployment failed

### 3. Trigger New Deployment
Run these commands to trigger a fresh deployment:

```bash
# Create a new branch for the fix
git checkout -b fix/github-pages-react-app

# Add any pending changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "fix: Ensure React app deploys to GitHub Pages"

# Push branch
git push origin fix/github-pages-react-app

# Merge to main to trigger deployment
git checkout main
git merge fix/github-pages-react-app
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
1. Go to: https://github.com/usexfg/DIGM/actions
2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Check if it completes successfully
4. Verify the `gh-pages` branch is created

### 5. Verify Site
After deployment completes:
- Visit: https://usexfg.github.io/DIGM
- Should show the DIGM React application (not README)
- Should have navigation, components, etc.

## Expected Result
- âœ… React app displays instead of README
- âœ… All DIGM features work (navigation, components, etc.)
- âœ… Professional application interface
- âœ… No more static README page

## Troubleshooting
If still showing README:
1. Check GitHub Pages settings are correct
2. Verify gh-pages branch contains built React files
3. Clear browser cache
4. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
